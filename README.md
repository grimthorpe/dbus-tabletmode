DELL tabletmode ACPI handler

These scripts provide ACPI handlers for DELL Latitude 7275 (and maybe other)
2-in-1 laptops.

The drive was to get a virtual keyboard to enable automatically when the
physical keyboard is undocked.

The plan is for these scripts to trigger a DBUS message that tells KDE Plasma
the machine is in tablet mode.
